# learn-with-me-compilers
Join me on my journey of learning compilers through popular resources.

Reading up [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
I will implement the language in java(with some personal additions) in the beginning, then C++ and then maybe Rust(not as easy due to lifetimes etc. etc.).

Next up is [Dragon Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools).
